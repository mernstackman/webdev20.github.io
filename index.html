<li><p>Callback url: This is the url where the user of your app (you) will be redirected back after successfully login/ authorize app to twitter. Make sure it contains "callback.php" at the end of the url. Example: "<a href="http://example.com/yourapp/callback.php">http://example.com/yourapp/callback.php</a>". Or "<a href="http://127.0.0.1/yourapp/callback.php">http://127.0.0.1/yourapp/callback.php</a>" if you are going to use your computer.</p></li>

<li><p>Check "I Agree" and click the showed "Connect To Twitter?" button.</p></li>
